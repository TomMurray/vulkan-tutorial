This is my repository for following along with [vulkan-tutorial.com](https://vulkan-tutorial.com).
I'm using SDL instead of GLFW, and I've thrown everything in one massive `main` function.
This isn't particularly readable or advisable coding - it's just for practice and my own understanding, so I can add comments etc. about certain things that were unclear as I go.
